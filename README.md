# Customer-Segmentation

## Introduction
The marketing team in your company, a grocery firm company, faces the problem of stagnant sales. All this time marketing team realizes that they apply the same strategies for all customers regardless of their profile and behavior. Hence, as a Data Scientist, you are assigned to help the marketing team to do customer personality analysis. This analysis is expected to help a business to better understand its customers and make it easier for them to modify products based on the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different types of customers. Through membership cards, you have some basic data about your customers like the year of birth, education, income, the amount spent on wine, the amount spent on fruits, etc. 
After doing the business requirement gathering, you plan to perform customer segmentation as a solution. By doing customer segmentation, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only to that particular segment to boost sales. Furthermore, you are also expected to provide actionable recommendations to the marketing team according to the results of the analysis.
